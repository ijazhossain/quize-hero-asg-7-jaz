                <span class="text-blue-400">forEach()</span> method takes every element of an array and
                executes an
                operation on each array element which is
                being provided as a function. This method does not return a new array but it changes the existing
                array.<br>
                <span class="text-blue-400">map() </span>method iterates every element of the given array to

                a new array.<br>
                <span class="text-blue-400">find() </span>method is used to find any element form an array
                which fulfils a
                given condition, instead of
                returning an array this method only returns the first element which satisfies the condition or returns
                undefined if so such element is not found in the array.<br>
                <span class="text-blue-400">filter() </span>method is used to create an array with those
                elements which fulfil a given condition provided to that method by a function. This method returns an
                array
                of element or elements which satisfy the provided condition.If so such element is not found then it
                returns
                an empty array.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Q.3: What is event loop and how does it works?</h2>
            <p class="mt-7 text-justify">
                The browser maintains a queue of events and behind the scenes the browser takes event from that queue
                constantly and processing them by calling appropriate event handler if there is any.<br>
                Javascript is a single thread programming language which means it can only execute one thing at a time.
                By using event loop JS can be able to process asynchronous code, the code which depends on timers,
                promises or responses from an external source.<br>
                The event loop in javascript can manage and process asynchronous code by placing them in a queue of
                events, without further waiting it allow the programme to run in a non-blocking way. When event loop
                finds an
                asynchronous operation then it added that to the event queue along with a callback function. After that
                it searches other events in the queue
                and runs them. If any event is processed then the event loop stops checking. Once the event
                is over then the event loop executes that operation and searching for another event again in the queue
                and this process goes on
                until the JS
                programme is stopped.
