                operation on each array element which is
                being provided as a function. This method does not return a new array but it changes the existing
                array.<br>

                given condition, instead of
                returning an array this method only returns the first element which satisfies the condition or returns
                undefined if so such element is not found in the array.<br>
                <span class="text-blue-400">filter() </span>method is used to create an array with those

                array
                of element or elements which satisfy the provided condition.If so such element is not found then it
                returns
                an empty array.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Q.3: What is event loop and how does it works?</h2>
            <p class="mt-7 text-justify">
                The browser maintains a queue of events and behind the scenes the browser takes event from that queue
                constantly and processing them by calling appropriate event handler if there is any.<br>
                Javascript is a single thread programming language which means it can only execute one thing at a time.
                By using event loop JS can be able to process asynchronous code, the code which depends on timers,
                promises or responses from an external source.<br>
                The event loop in javascript can manage and process asynchronous code by placing them in a queue of
                events, without further waiting it allow the programme to run in a non-blocking way. When event loop
                finds an
                asynchronous operation then it added that to the event queue along with a callback function. After that
                it searches other events in the queue
                and runs them. If any event is processed then the event loop stops checking. Once the event
                is over then the event loop executes that operation and searching for another event again in the queue
                and this process goes on
                until the JS
                programme is stopped.

            <p class="mt-7 text-justify">
                <span class="text-blue-500 font-semibold">chooseQuiz</span> function takes index and givenAns as two
                parameters for
                it. First it takes answers array to
                iterate each element of that array and checks if the element id is equal to quizData array at index
                position element id or not. After that it stores the result in isExist variable.<br>
                If isExist is a truthy value then it sets 0 to the serial variable and iterates each element of the
                answers array by a for of loop. If isExist variable object id is equal to answers array element id then
                it splice answers array by remove one element from serial position and add a new object as it's element
                which consists
                by spreading an object at quizData array at index position including givenAns as a new property to it
                and then break the loop. If isExist variable object id is not equal to answers array element id then it
                increase serial value by adding one.<br>
                On the other hand If isExist is a falsey value then it creates a new object by spreading quizData index
                position
                element (object) and added givenAns to its new property then push that object to the answers array
                as
                its
                element.<br>
                Lastly chooseQuiz function call displayAnswers function by setting answers array as it's argument.
